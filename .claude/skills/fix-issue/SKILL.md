# Fixing Github issues

When working on a Github issue in this project, follow this approach.Github

## Getting context

Always fetch the issue details first to understand the full context:

```bash
gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels
```

Read the title, description, and labels to identify:
- Affected files and components
- Type of fix needed
- Any related context

## Branching

Create a branch using the naming convention `fix/issue-<number>`.
    
```
git checkout -b fix/issue-<number>
```

## Implement standard

- Follow existing code convention 
- Write tests that match the style of similar tests
- Ensure existing test still pass
- Run `php artisan test` before considering the work complete
- Run `/format` command to ensure code style consistency

## Commiting

Use this commit message format:

```
Fix: <issue title> (#<number>)
```

## Creating the PR

Push and create a PR using the `gh` CLI:

```bash
gh pr create --title "Fix <issue title (#<number>)>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
Brief summary of what was fixed

## Changes
- List key changes made

Closes #<number>
EOF
)"
```

The PR should:
- Reference `Closes #<number>` in the body
- Summarize what was fixed
- Flag any concerns or areas needing review

## Output

When complete, provide me with a brief summary:

- Issue number and tittle
- What was changed
- Link to the PR
